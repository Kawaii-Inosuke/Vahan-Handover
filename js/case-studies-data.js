      'One of India’s largest quick commerce platforms sources last-mile delivery riders through a complex mix of channels running in parallel, including organic and digital funnels, rider referrals, multiple hiring agencies, and partner networks. At the scale of lakhs of monthly onboardings, this multi-channel model created a costly measurement problem.',

Attribution was inferred after the fact rather than declared at source, leading to disputed hires, inflated claims, and payout reconciliation that consumed time and eroded trust.
